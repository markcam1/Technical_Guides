## IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) for C/C++ 
### My choice
[Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)\
Pros: plug and play, integrated compiler\
Cons: doesn't have an integrated ouput window, so programs flash up in a CLI and disappear in seconds\

### Alternatives Desktop
[Eclipse CDT](https://www.eclipse.org/cdt/)\
Pros: integrated ouput window\
Cons: no built in compiler, must do a lot of configuration\
See [Instructions](#cdt) below.\
<br>
### Alternatives Online
[Online C++ Compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)\
[C++ Shell](http://cpp.sh/)

## Boost 
### Windows
Windows users can download compiled binaries from sourceforge. You must download the version appropriate for your compiler. Note that the version number is different from your Visual Studio version; the compiler version in Visual Studio 2015 is MSVC 14.0.

In the descriptions, 32-bit refers to the kind of code generated by your compiler and not the operating system. Code compiled for 32-bit will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows. Code compiled for 64-bit will only run on 64-bit versions of Windows. The CMake recipes used in exercism create 32-bit projects for Visual Studio, so download the appropriate 32-bit version of Boost.

[boost](https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.65.1/) binaries

Once you download the compiled binaries, install them into a suitable location. The installed location will contain a libraries directory named similarly to the install executable, such as lib32-msvc-12.0. Rename this directory to lib so that CMake can find the precompiled libraries. If you don't rename the directory you will see an error like this when you run CMake:
