## Boost 
### Windows
Windows users can download compiled binaries from sourceforge. You must download the version appropriate for your compiler. Note that the version number is different from your Visual Studio version; the compiler version in Visual Studio 2015 is MSVC 14.0.

In the descriptions, 32-bit refers to the kind of code generated by your compiler and not the operating system. Code compiled for 32-bit will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows. Code compiled for 64-bit will only run on 64-bit versions of Windows. The CMake recipes used in exercism create 32-bit projects for Visual Studio, so download the appropriate 32-bit version of Boost.

Once you download the compiled binaries, install them into a suitable location. The installed location will contain a libraries directory named similarly to the install executable, such as lib32-msvc-12.0. Rename this directory to lib so that CMake can find the precompiled libraries. If you don't rename the directory you will see an error like this when you run CMake:
