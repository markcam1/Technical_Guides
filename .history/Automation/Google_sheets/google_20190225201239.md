## Button configuration.
You will see the code below. 

```
function myFunction() {
  
}
```

Let's replace this placeholder code with some new code. All we are doing here is displaying a dialog when a button our new button is pressed. 

```
function showMessageBox() {
    Browser.msgBox('You touched me!');
  }
```
You can change the text inside the msgBox function _You touched me!_ if you want to see different text.
