7. AMP and non-AMP
8. [Metadata](https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-first-indexing#best-practices): should be present on both versions of the site. Make sure that titles and meta descriptions are equivalent across both versions of your site. --Google.

    * Zone indexes: weight for each type found in a section of the page.
    * Machine breaks page into blocks; sections with more text and less HTML code get preference over the inverse

### back page
* robot.txt: In practice, robots.txt [files](https://moz.com/blog/interactive-guide-to-robots-txt) indicate whether certain user agents (web-crawling software) can or cannot crawl parts of a website. These crawl instructions are specified by “disallowing” or “allowing” the behavior of certain (or all) user agents. -- [Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/robotstxt)
